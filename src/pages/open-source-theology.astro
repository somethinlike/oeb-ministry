          This isn't a slogan. It's a command — and it's the foundation everything
          here is built on. If God gives wisdom, understanding, and talent freely,
          then hoarding the fruit of those gifts behind paywalls and patents
          contradicts the nature of the Giver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early Church understood this. The apostles didn't franchise. The gospel
          was preached freely, copied freely, and spread by people who believed truth
          was too important to own. This site exists in that tradition.

        Those Who Gave Freely
      </h2>

          George Washington Carver
        </h3>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Carver discovered over 300 uses for the peanut and hundreds more for
            sweet potatoes, soybeans, and pecans. He revolutionized Southern
            agriculture and could have become one of the wealthiest men in
            America. He refused.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked why he wouldn't patent his discoveries, Carver replied:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-amber-400 pl-6 py-1 my-4">
            <p class="text-gray-800 italic">
              "God gave them to me. How can I sell them to someone else?"
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Carver saw his work as a conversation with the Creator. Every morning
            he walked into his laboratory and asked God what to reveal that day.
            He understood that his brilliance was a gift — and that gifts are
            meant to be shared, not monetized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thomas Edison offered Carver a salary that would be worth over a
            million dollars today. Carver turned it down. He lived simply,
            taught freely, and died having changed the world without extracting
            a dime from the knowledge God gave him.

      <!-- Johann Sebastian Bach -->
      <div class="mb-10">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
          Johann Sebastian Bach
        </h3>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Bach composed over 1,100 works — cantatas, fugues, concertos, and
            some of the most complex music ever written. On nearly every
            manuscript, he inscribed three letters: <strong>S.D.G.</strong> —
            <em>Soli Deo Gloria</em>, "To God alone be the glory."
          </p>
          <p>
            He didn't write music to build a brand. He wrote music as an act of
            worship. His manuscripts weren't guarded trade secrets — they were
            copied, shared, studied, and built upon by every generation of
            musicians that followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Bach did with those manuscripts shaped the very language of
            music. His <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em> — 48 preludes and fugues
            cycling through all 24 major and minor keys — was a proof of
            concept for equal temperament, the tuning system that made modern
            music possible. Before Bach championed it, keyboards could only
            sound good in a handful of keys. He showed the world that every
            key could sing. Every piano, every guitar, every orchestra
            today is tuned to the system Bach helped establish.
          </p>
          <p>
            His work on counterpoint — the art of weaving independent melodic
            lines into a unified whole — became the foundation of Western
            harmony. Haydn studied Bach. Mozart, upon hearing Bach's motets,
            said <em>"Now, here is something one can learn from."</em>
            Beethoven was raised on the <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em> and
            called Bach the "original father of harmony." Every composer who
            followed built on the framework Bach laid down.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason his influence runs this deep is inseparable from the
            fact that his work was freely shared. Bach's manuscripts were
            copied by his students, circulated among musicians, and studied
            by anyone who wanted to learn. When Felix Mendelssohn revived
            Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> in 1829 — nearly 80 years
            after Bach's death — it was possible only because the manuscripts
            had been preserved and passed along freely. That single
            performance sparked a Bach revival that continues to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern musical theory — functional harmony, voice leading,
            modulation, the entire tonal system that underpins everything from
            symphonies to jazz to film scores — traces a direct line back to
            Bach. Not because he patented a method or licensed a theory, but
            because he offered it to God and God gave it to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, every music student on Earth studies Bach. His gift to God
            became a gift to all of humanity — not because someone marketed it,
            but because truth and beauty, once released, find their own way.

            Carver and Bach aren't outliers. They belong to a long line of people
            who understood that knowledge hoarded is knowledge wasted:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>The monastic scribes</strong> spent their lives copying
              scripture and preserving knowledge through the Dark Ages — not
              for profit, but because they believed truth should survive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jonas Salk</strong> refused to patent the polio vaccine.
              When asked who owned it, he said: "The people. Could you patent
              the sun?" His decision made the vaccine accessible worldwide and
              saved millions of lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>William Tyndale</strong> was executed for translating the
              Bible into English. His crime was making God's word accessible to
              ordinary people. The establishment wanted to keep scripture locked
              behind Latin and institutional control. Tyndale believed everyone
              deserved to read it for themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the World Wide Web and
              gave it away. He could have patented the most transformative
              technology of the 20th century. Instead, he released it freely —
              and it changed everything.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The pattern is consistent across centuries and disciplines: the
            people who change the world the most are the ones who give their
            work away.

        The Open Source Connection
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The principles behind this site aren't new to the tech world either.
          The open source software movement — one of the most successful
          collaborative efforts in human history — runs on the same ethic:
          knowledge shared freely produces better results than knowledge
          hoarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linux powers most of the internet. Wikipedia educates billions.
          Open source code runs the infrastructure of nearly every company
          on Earth. None of this happened because someone charged for access.
          It happened because people chose to give their best work away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linus Torvalds didn't patent the Linux kernel. Jimmy Wales didn't
          put Wikipedia behind a paywall. The creators of the Internet's core
          protocols — TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML — released them as open standards.
          The result was the most powerful tool for human communication ever
          created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open source works because it trusts people. It says: "Here's the
          best I can build. Take it. Improve it. Share it." That's the same
          thing Carver said about his peanut discoveries. The same thing Bach
          said with <em>S.D.G.</em> on every manuscript. The same thing Jesus
          said when he told his disciples to give freely what they'd freely
          received.
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn't invent this ethic. We inherited it — from scripture, from
          history, and from a global community of builders who proved it works.

          <p>
            Security isn't a feature — it's the foundation. Every piece of user
            data is protected by multiple independent layers:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>
              <strong>Row Level Security (RLS)</strong> — Postgres policies
              enforce access control at the database level. Even if every
              other layer fails, your data is protected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Client-side encryption</strong> — Private notes are
              encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving your browser. The
              encryption key is derived from your passphrase via PBKDF2
              (600,000+ iterations). The server never sees your key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OAuth only</strong> — No passwords stored. Authentication
              is handled by Google, Microsoft, Discord, or GitHub via Supabase
              Auth with PKCE flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OWASP Top 10</strong> — Every feature is evaluated
              against the OWASP Top 10. Parameterized queries, sanitized
              Markdown rendering, CSP headers, no inline scripts.

      <div class="mb-10">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
          Built With AI. Auditable By AI.
        </h3>
        <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            This site is developed through AI-assisted engineering. A human
            developer sets the vision, ethics, and product direction. An AI
            agent (Claude, by Anthropic) implements the code, makes
            architectural decisions, writes tests, and enforces security
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't a shortcut — it's a higher standard. Every commit
            message, every code comment, and every architectural decision is
            written to be readable by both humans and other AI agents. The
            project documentation is designed for <strong>context
            portability</strong>: any LLM can be given the project files and
            immediately understand the codebase, review decisions, and flag
            potential issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why does this matter? Because accountability shouldn't depend on
            a single person's review. The codebase is structured so that:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>
              <strong>Any AI agent can audit it.</strong> Paste the project
              documentation into any capable LLM and ask it to review the
              security model, test coverage, or architectural decisions. It
              will have enough context to give a meaningful assessment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No shortcuts are hidden.</strong> Every trade-off is
              documented. Every known limitation has a comment explaining why.
              There are no <code>// TODO: fix later</code> items without a
              concrete plan attached.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tests are mandatory.</strong> Every feature ships with
              tests. Row Level Security policies are tested adversarially —
              verifying both that authorized users <em>can</em> access their
              data and that unauthorized users <em>cannot</em>. Snapshot tests
              are banned (they silently pass when behavior changes).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The AI is held to the same standard as a human
              engineer.</strong> If a future AI reviewer finds a legitimate
              flaw — a missing test, a security gap, a lazy shortcut — that
              is treated as a real bug, not a philosophical disagreement.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          The Standard
        </h3>
        <p class="text-blue-800 leading-relaxed">
          The code that handles your Bible notes is held to the same rigor as
          the code that handles your bank account. Not because a regulation
          requires it, but because treating people's relationship with
          scripture carelessly would be a failure of both engineering and
          theology. We build to a standard that is defensible under adversarial
          review — by humans, by AI, by anyone who cares to look.
