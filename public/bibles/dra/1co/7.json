And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife."},{"number":5,"text":"Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency."},{"number":6,"text":"But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment."},{"number":7,"text":"For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that."},{"number":8,"text":"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I."},{"number":9,"text":"But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt."},{"number":10,"text":"But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband."},{"number":11,"text":"And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife."},{"number":12,"text":"For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away."},{"number":13,"text":"And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband."},{"number":14,"text":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy."},{"number":15,"text":"But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace."},{"number":16,"text":"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"},{"number":17,"text":"But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach."},{"number":18,"text":"Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised."},{"number":19,"text":"Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God."},{"number":20,"text":"Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called."},{"number":21,"text":"Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."},{"number":22,"text":"For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ."},{"number":23,"text":"You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men."},{"number":24,"text":"Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God."},{"number":25,"text":"Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful."},{"number":26,"text":"I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be."},{"number":27,"text":"Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife."},{"number":28,"text":"But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned.

It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:"},{"number":30,"text":"And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:"},{"number":31,"text":"And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away."},{"number":32,"text":"But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God."},{"number":33,"text":"But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided."},{"number":34,"text":"And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband."},{"number":35,"text":"And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment."},{"number":36,"text":"But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry."},{"number":37,"text":"For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well."},{"number":38,"text":"Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better."},{"number":39,"text":"A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord."},{"number":40,"text":"But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God. "}]}
