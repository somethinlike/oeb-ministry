For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification."},{"number":6,"text":"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?"},{"number":7,"text":"Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"},{"number":8,"text":"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"},{"number":9,"text":"So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said?
