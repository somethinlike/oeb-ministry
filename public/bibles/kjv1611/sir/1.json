{"translation":"kjv1611","book":"sir","bookName":"Ecclesiasticus","chapter":1,"verses":[{"number":1,"text":"This Iesus was the sonne of Sirach, and grand-childe to Iesus of the same name with him; This man therefore liued in the latter times, after the people had bene led away captiue, and called home againe, and almost after all the Prophets. Now his grandfather Iesus (as he himselfe witnesseth) was a man of great diligence and wisedome among the Hebrewes, who did not onely gather the graue and short Sentences of wise men, that had bene before him, but himselfe also vttered some of his owne, full of much vnderstanding and wisedome. When as therefore the first Iesus died, leauing this booke almost perfected, Si rach his sonne receiuing it after him, left it to his owne sonne Iesus, who hauing gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one Volume, and called it Wisdome, Intituling it, both by his owne name, his fathers name, and his grandfathers, alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisedome, to haue a greater loue to the studie of this Booke. It conteineth therefore wise Sayings, darke Sentences, and Parables, and certaine particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God. Also his Prayer and Song. Moreouer, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped vpon their enemies. This Iesus did imitate Solomon, and was no lesse famous for Wisedome, and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.  Whereas many and great things haue bene deliuered vnto vs by the Law and the Prophets, and by others that haue followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and Wisedome, and whereof not onely the Readers must needs become skilful themselues, but also they that desire to learne, be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing : My grandfather Iesus, when he had much giuen himselfe to the reading of the Law, and the Prophets, and other Bookes of our fathers, and had gotten therein good iudgement, was drawen on also himselfe, to write something pertayning to learning and Wisedome, to the intent that those which are desirous to learne, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in liuing according to the Law. Wherefore, let me intreat you to reade it with fauour and attention, and to pardon Vs, wherein wee may secme to come short of some words which we haue laboured to interprete. For the same things vttered in Hebrew, and translated into an other tongue, haue not the same force in them : and not onely these things, but the Law it selfe, and the Prophets, and the rest of the Bookes, haue no small difference, when they are spoken in their owne language. For in the eight and thirtieth yeere comming into Egypt, when Euergetes was King, and continuing there some time, I found a Booke of no small learning, therefore I thought it most necessary for mee, to bestow some diligence and trauaile to interprete it: Vsing great watchfulnesse, and skill in that space, to bring the Booke to an end, and set it foorth for them also, which in a strange countrey are willing to learne, being prepared before in maners to line after the Law.
