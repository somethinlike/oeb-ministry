to make peace, and they accepted thereof."},{"number":61,"text":"Also the King and the Princes made an oath vnto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold."},{"number":62,"text":"Then the King entred into mount Sion, but when hee saw the strength of the place, hee brake his oath that hee had made, and gaue commandement to pull downe the wall round about."},{"number":63,"text":"Afterward departed hee in all haste, and returned vnto Antiochia, where hee found Philip to bee master of the citie; So he fought against him, and tooke the citie by force."}]}
