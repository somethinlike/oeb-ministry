him."},{"number":60,"text":"Then remoued he, and came with a great hoste, and sent letters priuily to his adherents in Iudea, that they should take Ionathan, and those that were with him: Howbeit they could not, because their counsell was knowen vnto them."},{"number":61,"text":"Wherefore they tooke of the men of the countrey that were authours of that mischiefe, about fiftie persons, and slew

with a certaine number went he forth."},{"number":66,"text":"And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent."},{"number":67,"text":"And when he began to smite them, and came vp with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the citie, and burnt vp the engines of warre,"},{"number":68,"text":"And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore. For his counsell and trauaile was in vaine."},{"number":69,"text":"Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gaue him counsell to come into the countrey, insomuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to returne into his owne countrey."},{"number":70,"text":"Whereof when Ionathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadours vnto him, to the end he should make peace with him, & deliuer them the prisoners."},{"number":71,"text":"Which thing hee accepted, and did according to his demaunds, and sware vnto him that hee would neuer doe him harme all the dayes of his life."},{"number":72,"text":"When therefore hee had restored vnto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Iudea, he returned and went his way into his owne land, neither came he any more into their borders."},{"number":73,"text":"Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Ionathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to gouerne the people, and he destroyed the vngodly men out of Israel."}]}
