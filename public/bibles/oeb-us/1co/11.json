But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered."},{"number":7,"text":"A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory."},{"number":8,"text":"For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man."},{"number":9,"text":"Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man."},{"number":10,"text":"And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels."},{"number":11,"text":"Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;"},{"number":12,"text":"for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God."},{"number":13,"text":"Judge for yourselves.
