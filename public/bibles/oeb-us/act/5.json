And after it was sold, was not the money at your own disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not to people, but to God!”"},{"number":5,"text":"As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and everyone who heard of it was appalled."},{"number":6,"text":"The young men got up, and, winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it."},{"number":7,"text":"After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."},{"number":8,"text":"“Is it true,” Peter asked, addressing her, “that you sold your land for such a sum?” “Yes,” she answered, “we did.”"},{"number":9,"text":"Then Peter said, “How did you come to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord?
