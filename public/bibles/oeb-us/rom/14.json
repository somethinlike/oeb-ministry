Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand."},{"number":5,"text":"Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind."},{"number":6,"text":"The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God."},{"number":7,"text":"There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;"},{"number":8,"text":"for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master.

Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord."},{"number":14,"text":"Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so."},{"number":15,"text":"If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love.
