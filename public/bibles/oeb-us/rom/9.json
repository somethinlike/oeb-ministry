Amen."},{"number":6,"text":"Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;"},{"number":7,"text":"nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’"},{"number":8,"text":"This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants."},{"number":9,"text":"For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’"},{"number":10,"text":"Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac."},{"number":11,"text":"For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,"},{"number":12,"text":"that the elder would be a servant to the younger."},{"number":13,"text":"The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’"},{"number":14,"text":"What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!"},{"number":15,"text":"For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’"},{"number":16,"text":"So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy."},{"number":17,"text":"In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’"},{"number":18,"text":"So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart."},{"number":19,"text":"Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed?
