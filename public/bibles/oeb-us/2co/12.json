But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations."},{"number":7,"text":"It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself."},{"number":8,"text":"About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me."},{"number":9,"text":"But his reply has been – ‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’ Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me."},{"number":10,"text":"That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ.

Forgive me the wrong I did to you!"},{"number":14,"text":"Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you.
