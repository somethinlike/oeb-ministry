I looked until its wings were stripped off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a person; and a human heart was given to it."},{"number":5,"text":"And I saw a second beast, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth, between its teeth; and they said to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’"},{"number":6,"text":"After this I saw another like a leopard, which had upon its sides four wings of a bird; and the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it."},{"number":7,"text":"After this I saw in the night-visions a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the rest with its feet; and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns."},{"number":8,"text":"While I considered the horns, another little horn came up among them, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; in this horn were eyes, like human eyes, and a mouth speaking arrogrant things."},{"number":9,"text":"“I waited until thrones were set up, and an aged one took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and his hair like spotless wool, his throne was fiery flames, its wheels burning fire."},{"number":10,"text":"A fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books were opened."},{"number":11,"text":"“I looked at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words which the horn spoke – I looked even until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to be fuel for the fire."},{"number":12,"text":"Also the rule of the rest of the beasts was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a fixed time and season."},{"number":13,"text":"“I saw in the night-visions that there came with the clouds of heaven one like a human being, and he came even to the Aged One, and was brought near before him."},{"number":14,"text":"There was given him dominion and glory, and sovereignty, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away, and his sovereignty one which will not be destroyed.”"},{"number":15,"text":"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved by reason of this, and the visions of my head troubled me."},{"number":16,"text":"I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me the interpretation of the things:"},{"number":17,"text":"“These four great beasts are four kings who will arise out of the earth."},{"number":18,"text":"But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, and possess the sovereignty for ever, for ever and ever."},{"number":19,"text":"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet:"},{"number":20,"text":"and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three horns fell – it that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, and it appeared to be greater than the rest."},{"number":21,"text":"I looked, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,"},{"number":22,"text":"until the Aged One came, and judgment was given to the holy one of the Most High, and the fixed time came that the holy ones possessed the sovereignty."},{"number":23,"text":"Thus he said: “The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms; and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces."},{"number":24,"text":"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings."},{"number":25,"text":"He will speak words against the Most High, and will continually harass the holy ones of the Most High; and he will think to change the fixed times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time."},{"number":26,"text":"But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his kingdom, to consume and to destroy finally."},{"number":27,"text":"The sovereignty, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will surely be given to the holy people of the Most High; his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and all dominions will serve and obey him.”"},{"number":28,"text":"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and I turned pale, but I kept the matter in my mind."}]}
