Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!”"},{"number":10,"text":"When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked –"},{"number":11,"text":"“Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied – “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”"},{"number":12,"text":"Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,"},{"number":13,"text":"and said to them, “Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.”"},{"number":14,"text":"While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them."},{"number":15,"text":"But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant,"},{"number":16,"text":"and said to him, “Do you hear what these boys are saying?” “Yes,” answered Jesus, “but did you never read the words – ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?”"},{"number":17,"text":"Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there."},{"number":18,"text":"The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;"},{"number":19,"text":"and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves.

What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’"},{"number":26,"text":"But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.”"},{"number":27,"text":"So the answer they gave Jesus was – “We do not know.” “Then I,” he said, “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things."},{"number":28,"text":"What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons.

A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad."},{"number":34,"text":"When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce."},{"number":35,"text":"But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third."},{"number":36,"text":"A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way."},{"number":37,"text":"As a last resort he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said."},{"number":38,"text":"But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir!
