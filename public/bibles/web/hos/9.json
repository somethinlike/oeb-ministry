You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor."},{"number":2,"text":"The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them, and the new wine will fail her."},{"number":3,"text":"They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria."},{"number":4,"text":"They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into Yahweh’s house."},{"number":5,"text":"What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?"},{"number":6,"text":"For, behold, when they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents."},{"number":7,"text":"The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great."},{"number":8,"text":"A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God."},{"number":9,"text":"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will punish them for their sins."},{"number":10,"text":"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.

There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception."},{"number":12,"text":"Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!"},{"number":13,"text":"I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer."},{"number":14,"text":"Give them—Yahweh what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."},{"number":15,"text":"“All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes are rebels."},{"number":16,"text":"Ephraim is struck. Their root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”"},{"number":17,"text":"My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations."}]}
