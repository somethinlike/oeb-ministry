Listen to me, and I will tell you more.”"},{"number":33,"text":"I said, “Speak on, my Lord.” Then said he to me, “You are very troubled in mind for Israel’s sake. Do you love that people more than he who made them?”"},{"number":34,"text":"I said, “No, Lord; but I have spoken out of grief; for my heart is in agony every hour while I labor to comprehend the way of the Most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.”"},{"number":35,"text":"He said to me, “You can’t.” And I said, “Why, Lord? Why was I born? Why wasn’t my mother’s womb my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the people of Israel?”"},{"number":36,"text":"He said to me, “Count for me those who haven’t yet come. Gather together for me the drops that are scattered abroad, and make the withered flowers green again for me."},{"number":37,"text":"Open for me the chambers that are closed, and bring out the winds for me that are shut up in them.

Just as there is no slowness of those who are last, even so there is no swiftness of those who be first.”"},{"number":43,"text":"So I answered, “Couldn’t you make them all at once that have been made, and that are now, and that are yet to come, that you might show your judgment sooner?”"},{"number":44,"text":"Then he answered me, “The creature may not move faster than the creator, nor can the world hold them at once who will be created in it.”"},{"number":45,"text":"And I said, “How have you said to your servant, that you will surely make alive at once the creature that you have created? If therefore they will be alive at once, and the creation will sustain them, even so it might now also support them to be present at once.”"},{"number":46,"text":"And he said to me, “Ask the womb of a woman, and say to her, ‘If you bear ten children, why do you it at different times? Ask her therefore to give birth to ten children at once.”"},{"number":47,"text":"I said, “She can’t, but must do it each in their own time.”"},{"number":48,"text":"Then said he to me, “Even so, I have given the womb of the earth to those who are sown in it in their own times."},{"number":49,"text":"For just as a young child may not give birth, neither she who has grown old any more, even so have I organized the world which I created.”"},{"number":50,"text":"I asked, “Seeing that you have now shown me the way, I will speak before you.
