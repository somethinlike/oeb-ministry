She broke the jar and poured it over his head."},{"number":4,"text":"But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?"},{"number":5,"text":"For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” So they grumbled against her."},{"number":6,"text":"But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me."},{"number":7,"text":"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me."},{"number":8,"text":"She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying."},{"number":9,"text":"Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”"},{"number":10,"text":"Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them."},{"number":11,"text":"They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.

Couldn’t you watch one hour?"},{"number":38,"text":"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.

But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”"},{"number":50,"text":"They all left him, and fled."},{"number":51,"text":"A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,"},{"number":52,"text":"but he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked."},{"number":53,"text":"They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him."},{"number":54,"text":"Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest.

What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death."},{"number":65,"text":"Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands."},{"number":66,"text":"As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,"},{"number":67,"text":"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”"},{"number":68,"text":"But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed."},{"number":69,"text":"The maid saw him and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”"},{"number":70,"text":"But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.”"},{"number":71,"text":"But he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”"},{"number":72,"text":"The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the words that Jesus said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept."}]}
