Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff."},{"number":12,"text":"Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you."},{"number":13,"text":"Get up!

It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households.
