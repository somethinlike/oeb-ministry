Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit."},{"number":3,"text":"You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you."},{"number":4,"text":"Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me."},{"number":5,"text":"I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."},{"number":6,"text":"If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned."},{"number":7,"text":"If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you."},{"number":8,"text":"“In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples."},{"number":9,"text":"Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you.

But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you."},{"number":16,"text":"You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you."},{"number":17,"text":"“I command these things to you, that you may love one another."},{"number":18,"text":"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you."},{"number":19,"text":"If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
