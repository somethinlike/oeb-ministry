For that day, he held his peace;"},{"number":5,"text":"but having gotten opportunity to further his own madness, being called by Demetrius into a meeting of his council, and asked how the Jews stood affected and what they intended, he answered:"},{"number":6,"text":"“Those of the Jews called Hasidaeans, whose leader is Judas Maccabaeus, keep up war and are seditious, not allowing the kingdom to find tranquillity."},{"number":7,"text":"Therefore, having laid aside my ancestral glory—I mean the high priesthood—I have now come here,"},{"number":8,"text":"first for the genuine care I have for the things that concern the king, and secondly because I have regard also to my own fellow citizens. For through the unadvised dealing of those of whom I spoke before, our whole race is in no small misfortune."},{"number":9,"text":"O king, having informed yourself of these things, take thought both for our country and for our race, which is surrounded by enemies, according to the gracious kindness with which you receive all."},{"number":10,"text":"For as long as Judas remains alive, it is impossible for the government to find peace."},{"number":11,"text":"When he had spoken such words as these, at once the rest of the king’s friends, having ill will against Judas, inflamed Demetrius yet more."},{"number":12,"text":"He immediately appointed Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and made him governor of Judea. He sent him out,"},{"number":13,"text":"giving him written instructions to kill Judas himself and to scatter those who were with him, and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the great temple."},{"number":14,"text":"Those in Judea who had driven Judas into exile thronged to Nicanor in flocks, supposing that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would be successes to themselves."},{"number":15,"text":"But when the Jews heard of Nicanor’s advance and the assault of the heathen, they sprinkled dirt on their heads and made solemn prayers to him who had established his own people for evermore, and who always, making manifest his presence, upholds those who are his own heritage."},{"number":16,"text":"When the leader had given orders, he immediately set out from there and joined battle with them at a village called Lessau."},{"number":17,"text":"But Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, yet not till late, having been delayed by reason of the sudden consternation caused by his adversaries."},{"number":18,"text":"Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the valor of those who were with Judas, and their courage in fighting for their country, shrank from bringing the matter to the decision of the sword."},{"number":19,"text":"Therefore he sent Posidonius, Theodotus, and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship."},{"number":20,"text":"So when these proposals had been long considered, and the leader had made the troops acquainted with them, and it appeared that they were all of like mind, they consented to the covenants."},{"number":21,"text":"They appointed a day on which to meet together by themselves. A chariot came forward from each army. They set up seats of honor."},{"number":22,"text":"Judas stationed armed men ready in convenient places, lest perhaps there should suddenly be treachery on the part of the enemy.
