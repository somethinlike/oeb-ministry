Command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be released, and become earth.

Command that I be released from my distress, now, and go to the everlasting place. Don’t turn your face away from me.”"},{"number":7,"text":"The same day it happened to Sarah the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana of Media, that she also was reproached by her father’s maidservants;"},{"number":8,"text":"because that she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaeus the evil spirit killed them, before they had lain with her.

I am the only daughter of my father, and he has no child that will be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging to him, that I should keep myself for a wife to him. Seven husbands of mine are dead already. Why should I live?

At that very time, Tobit returned and entered into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber."}]}
