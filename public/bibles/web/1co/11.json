For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved."},{"number":6,"text":"For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered."},{"number":7,"text":"For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man."},{"number":8,"text":"For man is not from woman, but woman from man;"},{"number":9,"text":"for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man."},{"number":10,"text":"For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels."},{"number":11,"text":"Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord."},{"number":12,"text":"For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God."},{"number":13,"text":"Judge for yourselves.
