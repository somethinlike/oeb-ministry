Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,"},{"number":3,"text":"for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?"},{"number":4,"text":"For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?"},{"number":5,"text":"Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?"},{"number":6,"text":"I planted.
