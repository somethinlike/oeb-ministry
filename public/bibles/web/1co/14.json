For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up."},{"number":6,"text":"But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?"},{"number":7,"text":"Even lifeless things that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?"},{"number":8,"text":"For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?"},{"number":9,"text":"So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air."},{"number":10,"text":"There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning."},{"number":11,"text":"If then I don’t know the meaning of the language, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me."},{"number":12,"text":"So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly."},{"number":13,"text":"Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret."},{"number":14,"text":"For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."},{"number":15,"text":"What should I do? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."},{"number":16,"text":"Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn’t know what you say?"},{"number":17,"text":"For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up."},{"number":18,"text":"I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all."},{"number":19,"text":"However, in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language."},{"number":20,"text":"Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature."},{"number":21,"text":"In the law it is written, “By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. They won’t even listen to me that way, says the Lord.”"},{"number":22,"text":"Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe."},{"number":23,"text":"If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy?"},{"number":24,"text":"But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all."},{"number":25,"text":"And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.
