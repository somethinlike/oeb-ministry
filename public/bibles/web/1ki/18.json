The famine was severe in Samaria."},{"number":3,"text":"Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.

Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.”"},{"number":6,"text":"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."},{"number":7,"text":"As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”"},{"number":8,"text":"He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”"},{"number":9,"text":"He said, “How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?"},{"number":10,"text":"As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you.

The God who answers by fire, let him be God.” All the people answered, “What you say is good.”"},{"number":25,"text":"Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”"},{"number":26,"text":"They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, “Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice, and nobody answered. They leaped about the altar which was made."},{"number":27,"text":"At noon, Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is deep in thought, or he has gone somewhere, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.”"},{"number":28,"text":"They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances until the blood gushed out on them."},{"number":29,"text":"When midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the evening offering; but there was no voice, no answer, and nobody paid attention."},{"number":30,"text":"Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me!”; and all the people came near to him. He repaired Yahweh’s altar that had been thrown down."},{"number":31,"text":"Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Yahweh’s word came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”"},{"number":32,"text":"With the stones he built an altar in Yahweh’s name. He made a trench around the altar large enough to contain two seahs of seed."},{"number":33,"text":"He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”"},{"number":34,"text":"He said, “Do it a second time;” and they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third time;” and they did it the third time."},{"number":35,"text":"The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water."},{"number":36,"text":"At the time of the evening offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word."},{"number":37,"text":"Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.”"},{"number":38,"text":"Then Yahweh’s fire fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust; and it licked up the water that was in the trench."},{"number":39,"text":"When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, “Yahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he is God!”"},{"number":40,"text":"Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!” They seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there."},{"number":41,"text":"Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”"},{"number":42,"text":"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees."},{"number":43,"text":"He said to his servant, “Go up now and look toward the sea.” He went up and looked, then said, “There is nothing.” He said, “Go again” seven times."},{"number":44,"text":"On the seventh time, he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the sea.” He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn’t stop you.’”"},{"number":45,"text":"In a little while, the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel."},{"number":46,"text":"Yahweh’s hand was on Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."}]}
