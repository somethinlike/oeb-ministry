For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!"},{"number":8,"text":"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire."},{"number":9,"text":"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you.
