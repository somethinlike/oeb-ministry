But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man."},{"number":4,"text":"Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God."},{"number":5,"text":"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death."},{"number":6,"text":"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter."},{"number":7,"text":"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”"},{"number":8,"text":"But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting.

May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was producing death in me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful."},{"number":14,"text":"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin."},{"number":15,"text":"For I don’t understand what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do."},{"number":16,"text":"But if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good."},{"number":17,"text":"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me."},{"number":18,"text":"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing.
