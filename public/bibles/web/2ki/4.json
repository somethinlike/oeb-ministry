Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’” She answered, “It is well.”"},{"number":27,"text":"When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”"},{"number":28,"text":"Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”"},{"number":29,"text":"Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again.

Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”"},{"number":32,"text":"When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed."},{"number":33,"text":"He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh."},{"number":34,"text":"He went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm."},{"number":35,"text":"Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth, then went up and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."},{"number":36,"text":"He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her.

As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it."},{"number":41,"text":"But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot."},{"number":42,"text":"A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”"},{"number":43,"text":"His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?” But he said, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”"},{"number":44,"text":"So he set it before them and they ate and had some left over, according to Yahweh’s word."}]}
